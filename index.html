    <p>This is a small test paragraph:</p>
    <blockquote>This is a short story about me and my <b>ambition</b> to become a <strong>software</strong> 
    and <strong>web developer.</strong> I am hoping that in time, laying <q><em>block</em> after <em>block</em></q>, 
    acumulating knowledge, I can one day achieve this dream of mine! I have poured many <i>resources</i>, as well as 
    <i>time</i> into this passion and I hope something will come back in return from all of this. Either way, I am 
    glad I can pursue this dream freely and that I am currently putting my newly bought HP laptop to good use!</blockquote>

    <h3 style="color: lightblue; background-color: black;">Information about the world we live in:</h3>
    <p id="P2">This is another paragraph I will use to try to explain to you different things about the world we live in. 
    For example, did you know you can blow stuff up with <strong><abbr title="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</abbr></strong>??!</p>
    <p>If you don't believe me, here's a picture of TNT:</p>

    <p>Well, it used to look like that... Might differ nowadays... It's quite an old photo :)</p>
